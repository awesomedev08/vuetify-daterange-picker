# Vuetify Daterange Picker

The missing date range picker for Vuetify JS you have been looking for.

> **IN RED COLOR** üö® This project is not maintained. I love that it received the attention it got. It is actually used by a lot of people and that gives me satisfaction. However, I don't have enough time to maintain it, look after issues or get up to speed with Vuetify's development. 

> I still welcome PRs for features and bug fixes but apart from that, you are on your own. It was always a hack and it would never be the date range input we all want from Vuetify. Sorry and thanks! 

> I highly recommend using https://vcalendar.io/.
